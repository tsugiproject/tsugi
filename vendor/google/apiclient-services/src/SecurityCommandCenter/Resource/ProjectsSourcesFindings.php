   *
   * @opt_param string compareDuration When compare_duration is set, the
   * ListFindingsResult's "state_change" attribute is updated to indicate whether
   * the finding had its state changed, the finding's state remained unchanged, or
   * if the finding was added in any state during the compare_duration period of
   * time that precedes the read_time. This is the time between (read_time -
   * compare_duration) and read_time. The state_change value is derived based on
   * the presence and state of the finding at the two points in time. Intermediate
   * state changes between the two times don't affect the result. For example, the
   * results aren't affected if the finding is made inactive and then active
   * again. Possible "state_change" values when compare_duration is specified: *
   * "CHANGED": indicates that the finding was present and matched the given
   * filter at the start of compare_duration, but changed its state at read_time.
   * * "UNCHANGED": indicates that the finding was present and matched the given
   * filter at the start of compare_duration and did not change state at
   * read_time. * "ADDED": indicates that the finding did not match the given
   * filter or was not present at the start of compare_duration, but was present
   * at read_time. * "REMOVED": indicates that the finding was present and matched
   * the filter at the start of compare_duration, but did not match the filter at
   * read_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible
   * state_change is "UNUSED", which will be the state_change set for all findings
   * present at read_time.
   * @opt_param string fieldMask A field mask to specify the Finding fields to be
   * listed in the response. An empty field mask will list all fields.
   * @opt_param string filter Expression that defines the filter to apply across
   * findings. The expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via
   * logical operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has
   * higher precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a
   * `-` character in front of them to indicate negation. Examples include: * name
   * * source_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The supported
   * operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for integer
   * values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings. The supported value
   * types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer literals without quotes. *
   * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes. The following field and
   * operator combinations are supported: * name: `=` * parent: `=`, `:` *
   * resource_name: `=`, `:` * state: `=`, `:` * category: `=`, `:` *
   * external_uri: `=`, `:` * event_time: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` Usage: This
   * should be milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string. Examples:
   * `event_time = "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"` `event_time = 1560208038000` *
   * severity: `=`, `:` * workflow_state: `=`, `:` * security_marks.marks: `=`,
   * `:` * source_properties: `=`, `:`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` For example,
   * `source_properties.size = 100` is a valid filter string. Use a partial match
   * on the empty string to filter based on a property existing:
   * `source_properties.my_property : ""` Use a negated partial match on the empty
   * string to filter based on a property not existing:
   * `-source_properties.my_property : ""` * resource: * resource.name: `=`, `:` *
   * resource.parent_name: `=`, `:` * resource.parent_display_name: `=`, `:` *
   * resource.project_name: `=`, `:` * resource.project_display_name: `=`, `:` *
   * resource.type: `=`, `:` * resource.folders.resource_folder: `=`, `:` *
   * resource.display_name: `=`, `:`
   * @opt_param string orderBy Expression that defines what fields and order to
   * use for sorting. The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated
   * list of fields. For example: "name,resource_properties.a_property". The
   * default sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field,
   * a suffix " desc" should be appended to the field name. For example: "name
   * desc,source_properties.a_property". Redundant space characters in the syntax
   * are insignificant. "name desc,source_properties.a_property" and " name desc ,
   * source_properties.a_property " are equivalent. The following fields are
   * supported: name parent state category resource_name event_time
   * source_properties security_marks.marks
   * @opt_param int pageSize The maximum number of results to return in a single
   * response. Default is 10, minimum is 1, maximum is 1000.
   * @opt_param string pageToken The value returned by the last
   * `ListFindingsResponse`; indicates that this is a continuation of a prior
   * `ListFindings` call, and that the system should return the next page of data.
   * @opt_param string readTime Time used as a reference point when filtering
   * findings. The filter is limited to findings existing at the supplied time and
   * their values are those at that specific time. Absence of this field will
   * default to the API's version of NOW.
