  /**
   * Lists events from a Google Chat space. For each event, the [payload](https://
   * developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces.spaceEvents
   * #SpaceEvent.FIELDS.oneof_payload) contains the most recent version of the
   * Chat resource. For example, if you list events about new space members, the
   * server returns `Membership` resources that contain the latest membership
   * details. If new members were removed during the requested period, the event
   * payload contains an empty `Membership` resource. Requires [user
   * authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-
   * authorize-chat-user). To list events, the authenticated user must be a member
   * of the space. For an example, see [List events from a Google Chat
   * space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/list-space-events).
   * (spaceEvents.listSpacesSpaceEvents)
   *
   * @param string $parent Required. Resource name of the [Google Chat space](http
   * s://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces) where
   * the events occurred. Format: `spaces/{space}`.
   * @param array $optParams Optional parameters.
   *
   * @opt_param string filter Required. A query filter. You must specify at least
   * one event type (`event_type`) using the has `:` operator. To filter by
   * multiple event types, use the `OR` operator. Omit batch event types in your
   * filter. The request automatically returns any related batch events. For
   * example, if you filter by new reactions
   * (`google.workspace.chat.reaction.v1.created`), the server also returns batch
   * new reactions events (`google.workspace.chat.reaction.v1.batchCreated`). For
   * a list of supported event types, see the [`SpaceEvents` reference documentati
   * on](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces
   * .spaceEvents#SpaceEvent.FIELDS.event_type). Optionally, you can also filter
   * by start time (`start_time`) and end time (`end_time`): * `start_time`:
   * Exclusive timestamp from which to start listing space events. You can list
   * events that occurred up to 28 days ago. If unspecified, lists space events
   * from the past 28 days. * `end_time`: Inclusive timestamp until which space
   * events are listed. If unspecified, lists events up to the time of the
   * request. To specify a start or end time, use the equals `=` operator and
   * format in [RFC-3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339). To filter by
   * both `start_time` and `end_time`, use the `AND` operator. For example, the
   * following queries are valid: ``` start_time="2023-08-23T19:20:33+00:00" AND
   * end_time="2023-08-23T19:21:54+00:00" ``` ```
   * start_time="2023-08-23T19:20:33+00:00" AND
   * (event_types:"google.workspace.chat.space.v1.updated" OR
   * event_types:"google.workspace.chat.message.v1.created") ``` The following
   * queries are invalid: ``` start_time="2023-08-23T19:20:33+00:00" OR
   * end_time="2023-08-23T19:21:54+00:00" ``` ```
   * event_types:"google.workspace.chat.space.v1.updated" AND
   * event_types:"google.workspace.chat.message.v1.created" ``` Invalid queries
   * are rejected by the server with an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.
   * @opt_param int pageSize Optional. The maximum number of space events
   * returned. The service might return fewer than this value. Negative values
   * return an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.
   * @opt_param string pageToken Optional. A page token, received from a previous
   * list space events call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When
   * paginating, all other parameters provided to list space events must match the
   * call that provided the page token. Passing different values to the other
   * parameters might lead to unexpected results.
