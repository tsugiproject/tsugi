   * call to list memberships. Provide this parameter to retrieve the subsequent
   * page. When paginating, all other parameters provided should match the call
   * that provided the page token. Passing different values to the other
   * parameters might lead to unexpected results.

   * associated with a Google Group, in addition to other types of memberships. If
   * a filter is set, Google Group memberships that don't match the filter
   * criteria aren't returned.
